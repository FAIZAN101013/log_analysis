# log_analysis
This script analyzes a log file to count requests per IP, find the most accessed endpoint, and detect suspicious IPs with many failed logins (HTTP 401 errors). It uses regular expressions to extract data, displays results in the terminal, and saves them to a CSV file for easy reference and organization.
